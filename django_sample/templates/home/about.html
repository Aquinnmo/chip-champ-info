                <h4>What We Do</h4>                
                <p>Project Noble provides a virtual alternative to physical poker chips for in-person Texas Hold Em games. Our service allows all players to join a game lobby on their individual devices, while we handle all chip management, side pots, and winnings calculations virtually.</p>

                <div class="alert alert-warning mt-4" role="alert">
                    <strong>Important:</strong> Our service handles NO actual transfers of money! That is handled outside of our service, to keep everyone's money as secure as possible.

                    <h4>About the Development Team</h4>
                    <p>This project was developed solely by Adam Montgomery. He is a driven developer that has always enjoyed games of Texas Hold 'Em with his friends, but always found himself in situations where he had no chips to play with.
                        That's why he created this site, to help people just like him.
